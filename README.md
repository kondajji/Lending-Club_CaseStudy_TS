# Project Name
> # Lending Club Case Study

This repository contains the code and presentation for a case study on identifying patterns of loan default using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The case study is conducted for a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers.

## Problem Statement
The company faces two types of risks associated with loan decisions:
1. Loss of business if a likely-to-repay applicant is not approved.
2. Financial loss if a likely-to-default applicant is approved.

## General Information
The objective is to use EDA to understand how consumer and loan attributes influence the tendency of default, aiding in decision-making such as loan approval, amount adjustment, or higher interest rates.
## Data Understanding
The dataset contains loan data from 2007 to 2011, including applicant attributes and loan outcomes. A data dictionary is provided to understand variable meanings.

## Approach
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and clean the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the relationship between various attributes and loan default.
3. **Insights and Observations**: Summarize insights and observations from the analysis.
4. **Presentation**: Create a presentation summarizing the problem statement, analysis approach, key findings, and visualizations.
